# Trigger Evals

## Should Trigger

- Split this package into clearer modules and update the ownership notes.
- This command is taking over responsibility from another subsystem; update the architecture.
- Add architecture annotations for this new service boundary.
- Refactor this component and keep the module map honest.

## Should Not Trigger

- Add one new product behavior claim.
- Check whether this single module is honestly implemented.
- Fix a bug without changing ownership or subsystem design.
- Decide whether repeated code should be a pattern or helper.
