# Use Project Patterns

## When To Use

Use this when a developer task involves repeated implementation shape:

- adding code similar to existing code
- reviewing whether a one-off approach should match the project style
- deciding whether repetition is a pattern or should become a helper/component
- documenting why several modules solve a problem the same way
- interpreting `special patterns --metrics`

The repo does not need Special patterns yet. This skill can introduce the first useful pattern.

## How To Use

1. Start with the problem shape: what situation keeps recurring?
2. Look for existing examples in nearby code.
3. If Special is present, run `special patterns` and then `special patterns PATTERN.ID --verbose`.
4. Use `special health --metrics --target PATH` when you are still deciding whether a repeated shape should become a pattern, helper extraction, or no action.
5. If there is no pattern yet, define one only when it will guide future code.
6. Write the pattern as rationale plus fit criteria, not just a name.
7. Attach `@applies PATTERN.ID` to source items that actually demonstrate the approach.
8. Use `@fileapplies PATTERN.ID` only when the whole file is the application.
9. Use `@strictness high|medium|low` when similarity expectations matter.

Example definition:

```md
### @pattern ADAPTER.FACTS_TO_MODEL
@strictness high
Adapt analyzer-specific facts into stable public model structs at the language-pack boundary so parser and tool details do not leak into shared output.
```

Example application:

```rust
// @applies ADAPTER.FACTS_TO_MODEL
fn summarize_repo_traceability(facts: LanguageFacts) -> RepoTraceabilitySummary {
    // ...
}
```

## What To Do With Results

- If code intentionally follows a pattern, add or keep `@applies`.
- If code is almost identical everywhere, extract a helper/component instead of naming a pattern.
- If the shared idea is only a principle or style rule, put it in docs/module text/lint instead.
- If pattern applications are too different, split or rewrite the pattern.
- If `special patterns --metrics` reports possible missing applications, inspect them manually; do not treat them as lint failures.
- If health reports a repeated structure that does not fit an existing pattern, inspect the concrete examples before creating a new pattern.
- After edits, run `special patterns --metrics --target PATH` when available.
