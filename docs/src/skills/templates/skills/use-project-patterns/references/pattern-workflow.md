# Pattern Workflow
@implements SPECIAL.DOCUMENTATION.SKILLS.FALLBACK.USE_PROJECT_PATTERNS
@applies DOCS.SKILL_SUPPORT_REFERENCE

Use this checklist when deciding whether repeated code should define or apply a pattern.

1. Identify the problem shape in plain language.
2. Check existing code examples.
3. Run `special patterns` if Special is configured.
4. Compare the candidate code to the pattern's rationale, constraints, and source applications.
5. Use health metrics when the question starts from raw repeated structure rather than a known pattern.
6. Apply the pattern only when the code is intentionally following the approach.
7. If the code is a near-exact repeat, extract a helper or component.
8. If the code shares only a broad value, use docs/module text/lint instead.
9. Run `special patterns --metrics --target PATH` after changes when available.

Good pattern definition:

```md
### @pattern ADAPTER.FACTS_TO_MODEL
@strictness high
Adapt analyzer-specific fact collections into stable public model structs at the language-pack boundary. Use this when internal analysis facts need to cross into shared Special output without leaking parser or tool-specific types.
```

Good source application:

```rust
// @applies ADAPTER.FACTS_TO_MODEL
fn summarize_repo_traceability(facts: LanguageFacts) -> RepoTraceabilitySummary {
    // ...
}
```

Poor pattern candidates:

- "Prefer clear names." This is style guidance.
- "Keep modules small." This is an engineering principle.
- Three identical parsing functions. This is probably helper extraction.
- One unusual workaround. This belongs in local code comments or module prose until it recurs.

Useful commands:

```sh
special patterns
special patterns PATTERN.ID --verbose
special patterns PATTERN.ID --metrics --verbose
special patterns --metrics
special health --metrics --target src/foo.rs
special patterns --metrics --target src/foo.rs
special patterns --metrics --target src/foo.rs --symbol parse_config
special arch MODULE.ID
```
