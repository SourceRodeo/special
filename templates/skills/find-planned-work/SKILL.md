# Find Planned Work

## When To Use

Use this when a task asks:

- what is still planned?
- what blocks this release?
- what work is promised but not current?
- where did we leave future requirements?
- should this backlog item become a tracked planned spec?

## How To Use

1. If Special is present, run `special specs --planned`.
2. Scope with `special specs --planned SPEC.ID` when the tree is large.
3. Read release metadata as a label for the intended release, not as a version range.
4. If Special is not present, inspect roadmap/backlog/release notes and convert durable product claims into `@spec ... @planned`.

Example:

```md
@spec EXPORT.PDF @planned 0.9.0
Users can export the current report as a PDF.
```

## What To Do With Results

- If a planned claim is now implemented and verified, remove `@planned`.
- If planned work is stale, update or delete the claim.
- If the item is only an internal refactor, track it outside product specs or use architecture annotations.
- If future behavior is buried in prose, move the stable claim into `@spec`.
