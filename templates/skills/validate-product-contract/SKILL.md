# Validate Product Contract

## When To Use

Use this when a task asks:

- does this test really prove the behavior?
- is this release claim safe?
- is this spec too broad or too vague?
- are we overclaiming current behavior?
- should this requirement be planned instead of current?

This skill can introduce Special if the claim is currently untracked.

## How To Use

1. Start from one exact behavior claim.
2. If Special is present, run `special specs SPEC.ID --verbose`.
3. If you do not know the id, run `special specs --current` or `special specs --metrics` first.
4. Read the claim before reading the verify.
5. Read the attached `@verifies` or `@attests` body.
6. Ask whether the artifact proves that exact claim through observable behavior or durable evidence.

Useful commands:

```sh
special specs --current
special specs EXPORT.CSV.HEADER --verbose
special specs --metrics
special lint
```

## What To Do With Results

- If the verify proves the claim, keep it.
- If the verify proves only part of the claim, split or narrow the spec.
- If the verify checks helper mechanics instead of behavior, replace or strengthen it.
- If the behavior is not ready, mark the claim `@planned`.
- If the claim is not product behavior, move it to architecture, pattern guidance, or ordinary docs.
- If the repo has no spec surface yet, add the smallest useful `@spec` and proof attachment instead of leaving the claim implicit.
