# Validate Architecture Implementation

## When To Use

Use this when a task asks:

- does this file belong to this module?
- is this module honestly implemented?
- did a refactor leave architecture annotations stale?
- is one file claiming too much ownership?
- should this code become a new module?

This can be used before or after Special is integrated.

## How To Use

1. Pick one intended boundary.
2. If a module id exists, run `special arch MODULE.ID --verbose`.
3. Read the module description.
4. Read the attached `@implements` or `@fileimplements` body.
5. Decide whether the code actually performs that responsibility.
6. Use `special arch MODULE.ID --metrics --verbose` when you need complexity, coupling, ownership, or hidden-item evidence.
7. If pattern applications appear, inspect them with `special patterns PATTERN.ID --verbose`.

Useful commands:

```sh
special arch MODULE.ID --verbose
special arch MODULE.ID --metrics --verbose
special arch --unimplemented
special lint
```

## What To Do With Results

- If the code matches the module, keep the annotation.
- If the description is wrong, edit the `@module` text where it is written.
- If the code belongs elsewhere, move `@implements`.
- If a file-level attachment hides unrelated items, use narrower item-level attachments or split the module.
- If a current module has no implementation, add implementation or mark it planned.
- If the issue is behavior proof, switch to product specs.
